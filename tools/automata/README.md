# Tools for Automata

- [JFLAP (JFLAP7.1; July 2018)](http://www.jflap.org/)

> JFLAP is software for experimenting with formal languages topics 
including nondeterministic finite automata, nondeterministic pushdown automata, 
multi-tape Turing machines, several types of grammars, parsing, and L-systems.
In addition to constructing and testing examples for these, 
JFLAP allows one to experiment with construction proofs from one form to another,
such as converting an NFA to a DFA to a minimal state DFA to a regular expression 
or regular grammar.

- [CoAn - Compiler and Automaton Network Simulator](https://www.elstel.org/coan/index.html.en)

> Full-fledged automaton simulator which can run finite automata, pushdown automata, 
Turing machines and machine schemata for deterministic and non-deterministic automata 
(all simultaneously active states are shown in light yellow).
Non-deterministic pushdown automata are shown with all possible stack contents 
for a certain activation. 
Use machine schemata to create and simulate more complicated Turing machines.
Clear tree structure to view, execute and safe different automata within a single file.

  - > Hint: Open Test2.atm to get a few examples. If the windows executables should not run then copy ucrtbased.dll into the coan-2.0-exe directory.

- [GOAL (Version 2020-05-06)](http://goal.im.ntu.edu.tw/wiki/doku.php)

> GOAL is a graphical interactive tool for defining and manipulating BÃ¼chi automata and temporal logic formulae. 
The acronym GOAL was originally derived from "Graphical Tool for Omega-Automata and Logics". 
It also stands for "Games, Omega-Automata, and Logics", as we gradually add support for omega-regular games.
